### Patch Changes

- 59d065b: Dependency refresh, all within the current majors and validated against Expo SDK 57
  (`expo install --check` reports the workspace aligned):

  - `react-native` 0.86.0 → 0.86.2 (and `@react-native/metro-config` to match; both stay
    pinned as singletons in the root `pnpm.overrides`)
  - `react-native-reanimated` 4.5.0 → 4.5.1 and `react-native-worklets` 0.10.0 → 0.10.1 —
    the versions Expo SDK 57 expects
  - `expo` 57.0.7 → 57.0.9 and the SDK-managed modules along with it (`expo-router`,
    `expo-constants`, `expo-linking`, `expo-system-ui`, `expo-video`,
    `@expo/metro-runtime`, `expo-build-properties`)
  - `babel-preset-expo` 57.0.3 → 57.0.5, Storybook 10.5.3 → 10.5.5,
    `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6.0.3 → 6.0.4, `next` 16.2.10 → 16.2.12,
    `@react-navigation/*` patch bumps

  The vendored `expo-modules-core` patch was re-pointed from 57.0.6 to 57.0.8 and still
  applies cleanly. `expo-audio` deliberately stays on 57.0.2, where our native sampling
  patch is pinned. Peer requirements for consumers are unchanged.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- caa2d7e: Point every `types` entry at the built declarations (`lib/typescript/*.d.ts`) instead of at the shipped TypeScript source.

  These packages ship their source and resolve it at runtime (`source`, `react-native` and `default` all still point into `src`), but `types` pointed there too — so a consumer's `tsc` typechecked the kit's raw source as part of their own build. That is slow, and it surfaces errors that depend on the consumer's own compiler settings, since `skipLibCheck` does not apply to `.ts` source files. Resolving `types` to real `.d.ts` files makes declaration handling both faster and inert.

  `@knitui/icons` also adds `lib/typescript` to `files`; its declarations were previously built but never published, so the new `types` path would not have existed in the tarball.

  `@knitui/emoji` deliberately keeps `types` on its source: its per-emoji modules ship as pre-generated `.js`/`.d.ts` pairs inside `src`, which `tsc` does not re-emit, so its built barrel cannot resolve them.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 5f44d20: Stop the icon barrel from being pulled into every component

  `@knitui/components` dragged all ~6.1k icon modules into any app that imported a
  single component. The kit SRC-SHIPS, so Metro compiles what it resolves and does
  NOT tree-shake: one line in `internal/ControlIconProvider.tsx` —
  `import { IconProvider } from "@knitui/icons"` — resolved the root barrel
  (`packages/icons/src/index.ts`, 378 KB / 6,153 export lines), and because that
  module is reachable from `Button`, `Chip`, `Accordion` and friends, every glyph
  became part of the graph. Walking the import graph from each package entry,
  honouring `exports` conditions and `.web`/`.native` order:

  | entry                | before                   | after                  |
  | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
  | `@knitui/components` | 6,490 modules / 4,896 KB | 344 modules / 1,635 KB |
  | `@knitui/sheet`      | 6,506 modules / 4,960 KB | 360 modules / 1,700 KB |
  | `@knitui/carousel`   | 6,541 modules / 5,068 KB | 398 modules / 1,808 KB |
  | `@knitui/media`      | 6,530 modules / 5,056 KB | 384 modules / 1,796 KB |

  That is −94.7% modules and −3,261 KB of source off the components graph, and it
  lands on Metro cold start, on every clear-cache rebuild, and on the JS bundle
  itself for consumers whose bundler cannot shake a src-shipped barrel.

  **`@knitui/icons` gains two subpath exports** (the minor):

  - `@knitui/icons/context` — `IconProvider`, `useIconContext` and their types
  - `@knitui/icons/types` — `IconProps`, `IconNode`, `IconComponent`, `IconType`

  Per-glyph deep imports (`@knitui/icons/IconCheck`) already resolved through the
  existing `./Icon*` wildcard; the provider was the one thing that had no subpath
  and therefore forced the barrel. Nothing was removed — the root barrel still
  exports everything it did.

  **Internal import rewrites** (patch, no API change) across the shipped source of
  `@knitui/components` (`ControlIconProvider`, `Accordion`, `Checkbox/CheckIcon`,
  `Chip`, `CloseButton`, `Combobox`, `Stepper`), `@knitui/carousel` (`Carousel`)
  and `@knitui/media` (the audio/video chrome + `LiveAudioMeter`), each now naming
  the glyph module it actually uses. An ESLint `no-restricted-imports` guardrail in
  `eslint.config.base.mjs` blocks the bare `@knitui/icons` / `@knitui/emoji`
  specifier in shipped `src/**` so this cannot regress; stories, tests and the
  private `@knitui/demo` galleries (which render the whole registry on purpose) are
  exempt.

  **Bundler hygiene, same theme:**

  - `sideEffects` was missing from `@knitui/media`, `@knitui/sheet` and
    `@knitui/plugins`, so webpack/Next had to keep every module of those packages
    even when nothing referenced it. `media` and `sheet` are declared
    `sideEffects: false` (audited: their only module-scope statements are pure
    const initialisers and a `displayName` assignment — the one
    `registerProcessor()` call in `media` lives inside an AudioWorklet source
    string, not in the module). `plugins` lists just its `babel-plugin` entry,
    which really does mutate `process.env.TAMAGUI_IGNORE_BUNDLE_ERRORS` on load.
  - `@knitui/plugins/next-plugin` now sets
    `experimental.optimizePackageImports` for `@knitui/icons`, `@knitui/emoji`,
    `@knitui/components`, `@knitui/dates` and `@knitui/map`, so every Next
    consumer inherits it instead of having to know. Next has to build a barrel's
    full module graph before it can shake it, and `transpilePackages` means it
    compiles the kit's source to do so — with this, a bare-barrel glyph import in
    app code is rewritten to that glyph's own module and the other 6,145 files are
    never compiled. Any `experimental` the app already set is
    merged, not replaced, and its own `optimizePackageImports` entries are kept.

### Patch Changes

- 5f44d20: Stop publishing the `lib/` build output that nothing can resolve

  Both packages listed `"lib"` in `files` and ran `bob build`, but **every**
  resolver key — `main`, `module`, `types`, `react-native`, `source` and every
  `exports` condition — points at `./src/...`. Nothing in either package, the
  workspace, or a consumer's resolution can reach `lib/`: these two src-ship, like
  the rest of the kit. The build output was shipped to npm as dead weight.

  Measured with `npm pack --dry-run`:

  | package         | before                 | after                 |
  | --------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
  | `@knitui/icons` | 23.6 MB / 43,096 files | 3.6 MB / 6,159 files  |
  | `@knitui/emoji` | —                      | 26.9 MB / 7,614 files |

  `lib/` was 36,937 of the 43,096 icon entries — 85% of that tarball — and 180 MB
  on disk for `emoji`. Install size only; no bundle, API or resolution change,
  which is exactly why it was invisible.

  `bob build` still runs, so the artefact is still produced locally and in CI. If
  that turns out to have no consumer either, the build target itself can go — but
  that is a separate call from what gets published.
